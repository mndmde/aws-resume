# aws-cloud-resume

As I am nearing the end of my AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam studies. I feel I need to be more hands on and demonstrate my problem solving skills with a project.

After some quick research I found a few people recommending the <a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/">Cloud Resume Challenge - AWS</a> on youtube.

The goal is to re-create your resume with HTML & CSS, host it on AWS, create a visitor counter using Javascript that retrieves the count from a DynamoDB database and create an API that communicates with the database using a Lambda function coded in Python.

There is also CI/CD implementation using Github Actions. I am now able to update the front end straight from my command line.

Finally, provisioning these services with Infrastructure as Code using Terraform.

Tech used:
<ul>
<li>S3</li>
<li>AWS CloudFront</li>
<li>AWS Lambda</li>
<li>DynamoDB</li>
<li>Github Actions</li>
<li>Terraform</li>
</ul>

<h3>Thoughts/Notes</h3>
This is my first project using multiple programming languages and implementing AWS technologies. This project was for me to grasp how all I can use these services together. I have learned a lot in during this project, it has given me practical hands-on experience and the confidence to take on more complex projects.
